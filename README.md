# CS-305-Software-Security

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a consulting company specializing in developing individualized financial plans for its customers, encompassing savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. Artemis Financial seeks to modernize its operations and enhance the security of its web-based software application, particularly its RESTful web API. They want to protect their organization from external threats and ensure security for their financial planning services. Global Rain has been engaged to conduct a vulnerability assessment to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities in its software application, thereby improving its security and resilience against potential threats and attacks.

What did you do well when finding your client's software security vulnerabilities? Why is it essential to code securely? What value does software security add to a company's overall well-being?
Our team excelled in identifying security vulnerabilities through comprehensive manual code review and static testing. Secure coding prevents data breaches, financial losses, and reputational damage. Software security adds value by safeguarding data, preserving trust, and protecting against costly cyberattacks, contributing to a company's overall well-being and long-term success.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The most challenging aspect of the vulnerability assessment was ensuring we thoroughly addressed all potential security vulnerabilities, as even minor oversights can have significant consequences. However, this challenge was also the most helpful, as it underscored the critical importance of meticulous and comprehensive evaluation in strengthening the software's security posture.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
To increase layers of security, we implemented both manual code review and static testing. In the future, we would further enhance our security assessment by incorporating automated vulnerability scanning tools to conduct regular scans and detect vulnerabilities in real time, allowing for more proactive and efficient mitigation techniques.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
To ensure the code and the software application were functional and secure, we conducted extensive testing to assess security, including unit, integration, and penetration testing. After code refactoring, we employed automated testing tools, such as static and dynamic analysis, to check for newly introduced vulnerabilities, ensuring the code remained secure throughout the development process.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
In this project, we utilized various valuable resources and tools, such as static analysis tools (e.g., Maven Dependency-Check), manual code review practices, and secure coding guidelines. These practices and tools will be highly beneficial for future assignments or tasks related to software security assessments, helping us proactively identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work you have completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
From this assignment, I could showcase the following to future employers:

Vulnerability Assessment Report: A comprehensive vulnerability assessment report highlighting my ability to identify, analyze, and mitigate security vulnerabilities in a real-world scenario, demonstrating my skills in security analysis and problem-solving.

Code Refactoring: Evidence of my expertise in code refactoring to improve software security and functionality while adhering to best coding practices, which are essential in maintaining and enhancing software quality.

Integration of Security Tools: Demonstrating my ability to integrate and utilize security tools like Maven Dependency-Check, highlighting my proficiency in leveraging technology to enhance software security.

Documentation: The ability to document vulnerabilities and mitigation plans, showcasing my communication skills and attention to detail in conveying complex technical information to non-technical stakeholders.

These examples would be tangible evidence of my skills, knowledge, and experience in software security and development.
